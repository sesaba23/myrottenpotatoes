Feature: movies should appear in alphabetical order, not added order

Scenario: view movie list after adding movie (declarative and DRY)

    Given I have added "Zorro" with rating "PG-13"
    And I have added "Apocalypse Now" with rating "R"
    Then I should see "Apocalypse Now" before "Zorro" on the RottenPotatoes home page stored by title
